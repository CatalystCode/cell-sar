Description: The YATE project aims to be a fully featured software PBX.
 .
 YATE is a next-generation telephony engine; while currently focused on Voice
 over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and PSTN, its power lies in its ability to be
 easily extended. Voice, video, data and instant messenging can all be unified
 under Yate's flexible routing engine, maximizing communications efficiency and
 minimizing infrastructure costs for businesses.

 This most recent version from the Yate software has bring several improvements
 over the previous versions:
 .
    * SCCP, TCAP, MAP and CAMEL, TCP and TLS in SIP
    * Jabber client and server
    * Support for more hardware interfaces and protocols - added SS7, analogic
      support, RBS, better ISDN, passive recording
    * Clustering, balancing and failover support, Linux-HA integration
    * Added MGCP and Jingle support
